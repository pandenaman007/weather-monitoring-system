Weather Monitoring System
=========================

Overview
--------

The **Weather Monitoring System** is a real-time weather data processing application that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for several metro cities in India. The system processes and displays information such as temperature, dominant weather conditions, and alerts if certain thresholds (e.g., high temperatures) are crossed.

The system supports weather data aggregation and visualization, and provides configurable alerting based on defined thresholds. It also includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the alerting system.

Features
--------

-   **Real-time weather data** for metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Hyderabad.
-   **Alerts** for high temperature thresholds.
-   **Temperature conversion** from Kelvin to Celsius.
-   **Data Visualization** of weather patterns (e.g., temperature trends).
-   **Configurable threshold values** for alert triggering.
-   Unit testing with `unittest` for robust code validation.

Technology Stack
----------------

-   **Programming Language**: Python
-   **API**: OpenWeatherMap API
-   **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib (or any other visualization libraries)
-   **Unit Testing**: `unittest`
-   **Package Management**: `pip`
-   **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

Setup and Installation
----------------------

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.x** must be installed on your machine.
-   Install `pip` if you haven't already.
-   You will need an API key from OpenWeatherMap.

### Clone the Repository

bash

Copy code

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-monitoring-system.git
cd weather-monitoring-system`

### Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

bash

Copy code

`python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate`

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages by running:

bash

Copy code

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Configuration

1.  **OpenWeatherMap API Key**:

    -   Go to `src/utils.py` (or wherever the API call is defined), and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.

    python

    Copy code

    `API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'`

2.  **Alert Thresholds**:

    -   In `src/alerts.py`, you can configure the temperature threshold that triggers an alert (default is 35°C).

    python

    Copy code

    `THRESHOLD_TEMP = 35  # You can change this value`

### Running the Project

1.  Run the main application:

    bash

    Copy code

    `python src/main.py`

2.  The application will fetch weather data at regular intervals (based on your implementation) and display it in the terminal along with any alerts for high temperatures.

### Running Unit Tests

To verify the functionality of the alert system, you can run the unit tests:

bash

Copy code

`python -m unittest discover -s tests`

This will automatically discover and run the tests located in the `tests` folder.

Docker Support
--------------

This project also includes support for running the weather monitoring system in a Docker container.

### Docker Setup

1.  Build the Docker image:

    bash

    Copy code

    `docker build -t weather-monitoring-system .`

2.  Run the container:

    bash

    Copy code

    `docker run -d --name weather_monitor -p 8080:8080 weather-monitoring-system`

The system should now be running in the container, and you can monitor weather data via the terminal.

How It Works
------------

1.  The `main.py` script fetches weather data for multiple cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
2.  The `alerts.py` module checks the fetched data to see if any cities exceed the defined temperature threshold.
3.  If any city exceeds the threshold, the system triggers an alert for that city, printing a warning message in the console.
4.  Unit tests validate the alert logic using various test scenarios in `test_alerts.py`.

Future Enhancements
-------------------

-   Add support for more cities.
-   Implement user-configurable alerts for other weather conditions like humidity or wind speed.
-   Add a web-based user interface for data visualization and alert management.
-   Integrate with more robust data storage and analytics systems (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
-   Use more advanced techniques for real-time data streaming.
